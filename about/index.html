        <h3>Hi there, I'm Shikha!</h3>
	<p>I'm a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence and Databases Lab, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, 
		Indian Institute of Technology Madras. I am working under the supervision of 
		<a href="http://iitm.irins.org/profile/10214">
		Prof. Deepak Khemani</a> who specializes in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in symbolic AI.</p>
	
	<p>I am broadly interested in understanding social intelligence and building artificial agents that exhibit social 
		intelligence. By social intelligene, I mean, an agent's ability to attribute mental states, beliefs, goals,
		etc to itself and others. An autonomous agent's ability to reason about the beliefs and goals of itself as 
		well as others will enable it to collaborate with other agents/humans towards a shared goal in social settings.
		But in such scenarios, the different agents may as well have conflicting goals, leading the whole thing towards
		an adversarial setting. I am interested in looking at the role of Deception that an agent may resort to while
		synthesizing its plan to achieve its goal.
